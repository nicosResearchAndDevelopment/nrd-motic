# motic.decide Complex Context

## [environment](./environment/environment.md)

### [weather](./weather/weather.md)

This is a more crisp usage of `environment`

### [requirement](./requirement/requirement.md)

Examine a set of resources, so it fulfills someone's
 [requirements](./requirement/requirement.md).

### [smelting furnace](./industrial/smeltingFurnace/)

Not so different from `weather` (temperature is also done),
 but a use case with a little bit more of *industrial* flavor...
   
## [event](./event/event.md)

[Here](./event/event.md) events are handled, like
 [*exhibition*](./event/event.md#exhibition),
 [*accident*](./event/event.md#accident) and a very complex
 use case called [*barbershop*](./event/event.md#barbershop).
